# FrontEndConnectFour
A basic connect four game using front end technologies such as Bootstrap and jQuery.

This is part of a Udemy course titled "Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp". This project wraps up the front-end section of the course, which includes lessons on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

This project is not live on the web, so to play you will have to clone the repo and pull up the path of the html file in a browser. Alternatively, you can use something like Live Server in VSCode (my preferred development tool), which will bring up the file on a virtual server in your default browser.
